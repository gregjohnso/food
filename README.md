Recipes for food I like to make

## Basics
Ingredients to be used for other things. 

### Awase Dashi
Japanese sock made with kombu and bonito flakes.  
Used in ramen, liquid for cooking rice, chawanmushi, etc.

- 8 cups Water
- 2x 10x10in kombu square
- 2 cups bonito flakes

Optional:
- dried shitake mushrooms
- onions

1) Soak kombu in water until soft at a minimum. Hours or overnight for more power.
Notes: 
   - Some resources say wipe it down with a damp towel first to remove "impurities" but not sure that does anything but remove some of the tasty msg part.

2) Bring to a light simmer. Let hang out for 20-30 minutes without boiling. Remove kombu before boiling liquid will become bitter.
3) Add in bonito at a light boil. Remove after a few minutes.
4) You can keep cooking this down with onions or whatever in it for a stronger flavor. 

### Sourdough culture


- Flour
- Water
- Large container
- Cheese cloth

1) Put 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of water in your container and cover lid with cheese cloth
2) Every day remove 1 cup of material and replace with 1/2 cup of each flour and water

Notes: This will spontaneously ferment. After a week-ish it starts getting super good. Use it for making bread, biscuits, etc. 

## Adult Beverages

### Negroni thing
It's a negroni. It turns out you can swap out most stuff. 

- 1 part campari
- 1 part sprit (normally gin)
- 1 part sweet spririt (normally sweet vermouth)

1) Mix things together in your glass. Put in a big ice cube. Stir until it's mellowed to your liking. Drink.
