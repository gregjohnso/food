## Awase Dashi
Japanese sock made with kombu and bonito flakes.  
Used in ramen, liquid for cooking rice, chawanmushi, etc.

- 8 cups Water
- 2x 10x10in kombu square
- 2 cups bonito flakes

Optional:
- dried shitake mushrooms
- onions

1) Soak kombu in water until soft at a minimum. Hours or overnight for more power.
Notes: 
   - Some resources say wipe it down with a damp towel first to remove "impurities" but not sure that does anything but remove some of the tasty msg part.

2) Bring to a light simmer. Let hang out for 20-30 minutes without boiling. Remove kombu before boiling liquid will become bitter.
3) Add in bonito at a light boil. Remove after a few minutes.
4) You can keep cooking this down with onions or whatever in it for a stronger flavor.
